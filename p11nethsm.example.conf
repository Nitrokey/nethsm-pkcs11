# Set this option to true to enable the compatibility option for the C_SetAttributeValue() function.
# This allows the applications using the Java Sun PKCS11 module (like EJBCA) to generate keys.
# When using this, the names given to the keys will be ignored and the keys will have random names.
# Under the hood it will store in memory the name given to the key when calling C_SetAttributeValue(). When a certificate is uploaded it will check if the name was previously passed to C_SetAttributeValue() and translate it to the real name on the NetHSM.

# By default, the module logs to syslog, trying the sockets /dev/log, /var/run/syslog and finally /var/run/log
# A custom socket can be configured:
syslog_socket: /var/nethsm/log
# A custom UDP or TCP syslog can be configured:
# syslog_udp: 
#    to_addr: 127.0.0:1:514
#    from_addr: 127.0.0:1:4789
# syslog_tcp: 127.0.0.1:601
# You can configure the syslog facility ( "kern", "user", "mail", "daemon", "auth", "syslog", "lpr", "news", "uucp", "cron", "authpriv", "ftp", "local0", "local1", "local2", "local3", "local4", "local5", "local6" or "local7"):

# You can set the hostname (for use only with syslog_udp or syslog_tcp)
# syslog_hostname: "localhsm-pkcs11"
# You can set the process name (defaults to the process name obtained from the OS)
# syslog_process: "NetHSM Pkcs11"
# You can set the pid used in logs (defaults to the process id obtained from the OS)
# syslog_pid: 0
# If not using Syslog, you can configure a custom file, or "-" for stderr. Incompatible with any "syslog_*"" option
# log_file: /tmp/p11nethsm.log
# Only one option among "syslog_socket", "syslog_udp", "syslog_tcp", and "log_file" can be configured at the same time
